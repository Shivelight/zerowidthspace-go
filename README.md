# Zero Width Space

At one point, I'm so tired of leaving my terminal and editor window to launch firefox to search and copy zero width space. Later, I found out that you can do <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> on Linux, on Sublime Text it might not work; instead you do <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd>. But before that, I have this idea to make a simple script/program to put a zero-width space to my clipboard, to be honest, I don't know how to use golang, so I told myself this might be an excellent start to dive into golang. I lmao'd myself after.
